The π-calculus is one of the most successful computational models for
communication and concurrency. It abstracts over the details of concurrent
processing and boils the interactions down to the sending and receiving of data
over communication channels. In this talk, I will first present the syntax and
the operational semantics of the π-calculus with the help of some examples. On
top of it, I will then introduce session types, a type formalism for
communicating concurrent programs. I will comment on the key ideas behind them
and list the properties that session-typed programs exhibit. Finally, I will
mention some of the possible extensions to session types and comment on more
advanced type systems.
